       Pokémon is a video game series that originated in 1996. In the game the user obtains a party of up to 6 Pokémon and battles them against other Pokémon. The battles are turn based where each Pokémon selects an attack. Once a Pokemon runs out of health points the user can choose another Pokemon to take its place in the battle. When the user runs out of Pokemon the battle is over and the trainer with remaining Pokemon is declared the victor.
       
       Each attack does not have a set amount of damage dealt. Instead the damage depends on the type of the move, the type of the attacking pokemon, and the type of the opposing pokemon. It also depends on the level of each Pokemon. For example, a level 100 Pikachu would do much more damage than a level 90 Pikachu, even though they are the same Pokemon.
       
       My idea for is project is creating a battle simulator, where up to 6 pokemon can be created for each trainer. 4 different moves can be added per Pokemon. The damage dealt would then be calculated using the same algorithm as in the game. If time allows I may even add in functionality that given a type of Pokemon would return which type of attacks it is weak against.
